# This folder contains all your test files.
# These files are conventionally named test_*.

# It is not required that all your files need to be in this folder,
# you can create subfolders.
# For eg. all the tests for main Blueprint could go in the sub folder
# flask-quickstart/tests/main/

# There is a test_main.py included in this folder for reference.
# I'm using unnitest module from the standard library.
# There are other options available like pytest, nose etc.
